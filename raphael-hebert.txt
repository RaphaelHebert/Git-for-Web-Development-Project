Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
	Inline elements are displayed inline (not on a new line) and have the width of their content while block element are displayed on a new line, have the width of their parent element and the height of their content.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
	When an element is positioned absolutely it is taken off the normal flow of the page: its position depends of its closest parent absolutely or relatively positioned, it does not contribute to the size of its parents.it can be sized with the box offset properties: top, bottom, left, right.
 
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
	Set the width property to the desired value, set height property to auto.

    4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
	Block: <p>, <div>, <section>
	Inline: <span>, <button>
	inline-block: <img>

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
	The box model aim to represent html element as rectangles (with height and width).
	The rectangle contains the the content in the center, the padding around the content, the border around the padding and the margin around the border. The width of the whole rectangle can be calculated in different way depending on the value of the box-sizing property. If this property is set to content-box the values of height and width for a given element will be applied to its content and will not include the size of the border and the padding. This is the way you can make all element of the box respect the size that was given to them.
